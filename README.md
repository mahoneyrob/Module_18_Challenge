# Module_18_Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze different cryptocurrencies based on 4 factors, the Algorithm used, ProofType, Total Coins Mined, and the Total Coin Supply.  The objects were clustered in to 4 classes, and then plotted in both a 2D plot with the coins mined and supplied, and with a 3D plot that was based on reducing all data to 3 principal components.
